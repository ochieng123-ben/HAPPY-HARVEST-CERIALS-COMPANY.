## Brand Identity

### 🌈 Color System
- **Primary – #F4A261:** A warm, golden hue representing grain, harvest, and sunshine. Used in buttons, key headings, and accent elements to convey warmth and vitality.  
- **Secondary – #2A9D8F:** A fresh teal tone symbolizing nature, health, and balance. Applied to backgrounds and section highlights for contrast.  
- **Neutral – #264653:** Deep navy for typography and contrast, ensuring readability and grounding the palette.  
- **Accent – #E9C46A:** Used sparingly for highlights and decorative elements to maintain visual balance and brand energy.

### ✍️ Typography
- **Headings:** *Poppins, sans-serif* — modern and geometric, giving a clean and approachable character that reflects the brand’s freshness.  
- **Body:** *Inter, sans-serif* — optimized for legibility across devices, ensuring a comfortable reading experience for longer text.

## Design Decisions

### 📐 Layout Adherence
- The layout grid and spacing were implemented following an **8px spacing system** for consistent alignment and visual rhythm.  
- **Figma** was used to translate the design mockups accurately into responsive code, ensuring pixel-perfect results.  

### 🎨 Creative Departures
- A story-driven content strategy focuses on connecting with users emotionally through visuals and product storytelling.  
- The homepage was optimized for quick scanning — hero section emphasizes brand promise, followed by featured products and sustainability highlights.  
- At **medium (MD) breakpoints**, typography scales down and layout stacks vertically to maintain a natural reading flow.

## 🧩 Component Architecture
The site follows a **modular React component architecture**, ensuring reusability and maintainability:
- **Reusable UI Components:** Buttons, Cards, ProductList, and Navbar are abstracted for consistent styling and easy scalability.  
- **Page-Level Containers:** Home, About, Products, and Contact pages each manage their respective data and composition.  
- **Atomic Design Principles:** Components were built from atoms (buttons, inputs) to molecules (cards, navigation) and templates for scalability.

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- Implemented **Vite** for ultra-fast development and optimized builds.  
- **Tailwind CSS** purging enabled to remove unused CSS classes in production.  
- **Image optimization** via modern formats (WebP) and responsive sizing.  
- **Lazy loading** applied to non-critical components and images for improved initial load time.
